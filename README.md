# Welcome to my Github profile,
## I'm Loreleï, also known as taisezmoi but long story short :
### I'm a Front dev (work-study program) @ [Akawaka](https://www.akawaka.fr/) | Enthralled by old tech & floppy disks 💾

- 💻 [On my spare time] Currently working on my website https://www.taisezmoi.com
- ☝️ Learning Vue.js, React & how not to depreciate my value on a daily basis as a human being
- 🩵 Flabbergasted by what github has to offer (and by the word 'flabbergasted' itself)

You can find me on the main social networks under the pseudonym @ taisezmoi, but be warned it may not be a good idea (I'm chatty).
